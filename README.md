solutions for advent of code (hopefully)

Just compile one of the C files (later days have them conveniently named after the first or second part), the libft library and the parsing.c file(if there is one)
Also there is like 2 or 3 days with a utils file you're gonna have to compile as well
Also the first couple of days had my getnextline not in libft, I could fix it, but im lazy so compile that as well
Dont look at day 16 if you're a norm enjoyer, normie

if the libft.a is complaining cause of wrong architecture or whatever it means, just go inside the libft folder in the root of the repository\
run make and replace the complaning libft.a with the one you just compiled

I am not held responsible for any damage to your eyes or your sanity when reading the code. If you actually lost some brain cells, feel free\
to message me on slack and I'll say "I'm sorry", maybe send you some thoughts and prayers.
